# ADAB - Ayo Dengar Ayo Bicara (Let's Hear & Talk)
[![Netlify Status][]][Netlify Repo]

An open-source web and mobile application to help hearing-impaired students in the all-online world. We develop this app mainly to help our friends at [Binus University](http://binus.ac.id/), but we hope to be also used outside. There's a [paper](https://www.online-journals.org/index.php/i-jet/article/view/12147) about this project if you like to learn more.

## Full documentation
To check the full documentation visit [this site](https://bearcatsdev.github.io/docs/adab/guide/).

## Issues, bugs, and requests
We welcome contributions and feedback! Please file a request in our [issue tracker](https://github.com/bearcatsdev/adab-web/issues) and we'll take a look.

For simple changes (such as to CSS and text), you probably don't need to build this site. Often you can make changes using the GitHub UI.

If you want/need to build, read on.

## Building the app
